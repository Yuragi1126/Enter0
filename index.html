    <p>Today, March 20,</p>
    <p>a young boy was found collapsed on the side of the road following an emergency call.</p>
    <p>Police responded promptly and transported the child to the hospital,</p>
    <p>where he was later pronounced dead.</p>
    <p>Authorities stated that the cause of death was likely due to "overwork",</p>
    <p>though experts have indicated that multiple other factors may have contributed to the incident.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>Records of the inital news reports still remain.</p>
    <p>Approximately five years ago, in 1885,</p>
    <p>it was reported that a young boy named ≪Charde・Loucheur≫ died from overwork.</p>
    <p>Later, it was revealed that he had been subjected to a life resembling abuse within his household.</p>
    <p>While the subsequent fate of his family was not discussed,</p>
    <p>a letter believed to have been written on the day before or shortly before his death on March 20 was reportedly discovered.</p>
    <p>The letter was written in what appeared to be shaky, childish handwriting, addressed to his sister.</p>
    <p>The full contents of the letter were not disclosed. Though it was not considered a typical farewell note,</p>
    <p>it was nonetheless regarded as a ≪final letter≫ and treated as a will.</p>
